<h3>Tech Stack:</h6>
C# | Windows Forms App (.NET Framwork) | CockroachDB | Visual Studio

<h3>Development Process:</h3>
In the beginning I was using SQLITE for the database on my local system and my main focus was more on functionality than form but since this is an ongoing project I will be continuously making improvements to the user interface and also the backend. 

<h3>Hosting Service:</h3>
For the database hosting I am using a free hosting service called CockroachDB which basically performs querys and other operations similar to normal SQL syntax but in the command line. For the .NET Application, I have published it as a .exe file using a Nuget Package called Costura.Fody.

<h3>Run Task Manager on Local System</h3>
Fork this repo and copy the link in the your Forked repo and then open Visual Studio, click clone repository and paste the link. Also you will need to create a DB.cs file with your own connection by using cockroachDB to creat the database and tables required. 

<h3>Download Task Manager</h3>
