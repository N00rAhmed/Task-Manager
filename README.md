<h3>Hosting Service:</h3>
For the database I am using a free hosting service called CockroachDB which basically performs querys and other operations similar to normal SQL syntax. For the C# Application, I have published it as a .exe file inside a folder containing all of the packages needed to run the application so that it can be used by anyone.
